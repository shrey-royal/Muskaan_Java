Control Statements in java: control statements allow you to control the execution of the program based on conditions that you specify.

Java Control Statements

1. if statements -> the flow of the program will be controlled by the conditions that we specify.
2. switch case -> the user will control the flow of the program.
3. loops -> used to execute a set of statements repeatedly until a particular condition is satisfied.
4. break -> used to terminate the execution of a loop.
5. continue -> used to skip the execution of the current iteration of a loop.
