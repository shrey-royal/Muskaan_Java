OOPs: Object Oriented Programming System
> It is a Programming paradigm that provides many concepts such as inheritance, data binding, polymorphism etc.

OOPs provides many concepts such as:


0. Classes and Objects
1. Inheritance : It is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.

2. Polymorphism : It is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways.

3. Abstraction : It is a concept of hiding the internal details and describing things in simple terms.

4. Encapsulation : It is a concept of binding data and functions that manipulate the data and that keeps it safe from outside interference and misuse.


> Coupling, Cohesion, Association, Aggregation, Composition, Generalization, Realization are the concepts that are used in OOPs.

Object: Object is an real-world entity that has state and behavior. It may be any real-world object like the mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc.

sometimes They can be logical or conceptual. and sometimes they are physical. 

Objects are an Instance of any Class.

When a class is defined no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

Class: A class is a group of objects which have common properties. It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created. It is a logical entity.


Q. School is class, Why?
>  School is just a logical entity It is just a blueprint or template from which objects are created.

> Students are objects, Staff, Teachers are objects.

> Coupling means dependency between the classes. It shows how much a class is dependent on other classes.

> Cohesion means how much a class is related to itself.


fun1() {    //coupling is high in this, because it is dependent on func2
    fun2(); //this is the only code in func1 
}

func2() {   //coupling is low in this, because it is not dependent on any other func
    statement;//this is the only code in func2
}

// we have to make such code that coupling is low and cohesion is high.

The Tv Show called Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah is class, and all the characters are objects.

//Taarak Mehta
//Jethalal
//Daya

    //data members / class variables / instance variables
